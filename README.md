The project was executed using Django framework and contains two apps :

- Project portfolio site: This is a project portfolio site where projects that 
has been executed by an individual can be showcased and can serve as reference for potential
employers to have a feel of what the individual is capable of.

It has two main pages namely:

-Index page: This is the page contains the list of all the projects.

-Detail page: This page displayes the full detail of any project clicked
on the index page.


- Blog App: This is another application that enables the blog owner to post any topic of interest
for reader to read and make comments if they wish. It may as well be used as a medium to share knowledge.
The blog created in such a manner that each post belongs to a category.Each post must have a title,
category and body which carries the message to be passed across.

The blog has three major pages:

-Index page: The index page lists all the posts including the title, category, date posted, and some part of
the body (limited to 400 characters).

-Detail page: the detail page displays the full post of any post clicked on the index page. The title,category, date posted,
